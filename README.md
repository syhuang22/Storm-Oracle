In 2023, the world witnessed the rise of catastrophe bond funds. These funds rely on accurate predictions of natural disasters, especially typhoons and hurricanes, to protect investors' interests and earn high returns. However, the unpredictability of these disasters keeps many investors awake at night. Faced with this challenge, I decided to develop an innovative development application that combines big data and multi-modal machine learning models to predict the occurrence, path and intensity of typhoons and hurricanes, provide more stable investment forecasts for the disaster bond market, and also help Prepare people around the world to reduce casualties and property losses.
